# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DevUtils! üòä

I do accept PRs, but to do it, I'll need your help to sign an "Individual Contributor License Agreement" that I will send to you.

In short, this agreement grants the copyright of the changes in the PR to me. The reason for this is I want to have the necessary control when I need to change the project to a more restrictive license, or to sell it, or to build a commercial version of it in the future. 

That's all! Thank you very much for your understanding! üôè

## About DevUtils open-source license

I drank 10 cups of [cafe sua da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_iced_coffee) ‚òïÔ∏è  and built DevUtils in 8 hours.

Just kidding.

It takes months and years of learning, experimenting, user interviewing, ~copying~ writing code, testing,... to build the app. I've taken too many nights and weekends to write code instead of watching Netflix or traveling and have fun (if COVID even allows it).

The point is: DevUtils is open-source, but it is not free.

It takes time and effort to develop, distribute, maintain, and provide supports for users who use the app.

The main purpose I made the DevUtils source code available is to allow everyone to inspect and audit the source code. That way, we can all agree that the app has no shady code that messes around with the data users pasted into it or trying to steal users' Bitcoin.

For that reason, DevUtils.app's source code is available under the [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license. This is quite a restrictive license, you may have heard dramas about it, but it provides the protections necessary for me to continue working on DevUtils.

Here are some relevant notes about this license:
- Everyone can read/audit the source code, learn from it (or laugh at it üôÑ).
- Everyone can build the app binary from the source code and use it by themself (but no commercial use).
- Everyone can modify the code as they like, but they must not redistribute, share, or sell the modified code.

Of course, I have no way to control what people actually do with the source code. So this is mostly for formality's sake.

I trust people to play fair and not abuse the source code, and I hope DevUtils gained people's trust by making the source code open. 

If you want to support DevUtils, please consider [purchasing a license](https://devutils.app). It's a one time purchase.

That's all. Thanks!
